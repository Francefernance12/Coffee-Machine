# Coffee-Machine
# Description
This is a simulation of a coffee machine where users can choose their type of coffee and add coins to make a purchase. The machine then calculates the payment to determine if it meets or exceeds the required amount for the chosen coffee. If the condition is not met, the machine provides a refund. If the condition is met, it dispenses the change and the selected coffee. Additionally, the coffee machine has a hidden command to turn it off and another command to display its available resources for making coffee.
